# Background Generator

### How to get started
1. Open the page (https://sebastianberge.github.io/background-generator/)
2. Choose the first color, if the "standard" colors doesnt suit you, you could choose the "color picker".
3. Then choose the second color.
4. The css-proporty will update to match your selected colors. Copy and paste the linear-gradient link into your project!

### Common issues
Color-picker doesnt work properly in Safari, so I recommend using Chrome etc.
(UPDATE) Should work fine in Safari, last checked with Catalina OS.
